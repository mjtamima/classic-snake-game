# classic-snake-game

#The code runs a version of the classic snake game. The snake is controlled by W (up), S (down) and A (left), D (right)

#If the snake hits the boundary or touches any part of its body the game is over

#Score increases by 1 every time it touches a goal (represented by the red dot)

#The length of the snake keeps increasing each time snake eats a goal
